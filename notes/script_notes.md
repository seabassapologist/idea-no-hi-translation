# Script Notes

These are just thoughts and observations I've gathered from research. Whomever translates this can feel free to correct these or suggest better ideas!

* The name of one of the main characters is up for interpretation possibly. In game his name is spelled 雷岩, and the author of the walkthrough translated as "Kaminariiwa" and this seems to be the more common literal reading for those characters. However, looking at the [game's manual](https://note.com/kojiaihara/n/n3ee2f2e7f6f4), there's furigana in his section for らいがん, or "Raigan"
    * The latter is definitely preferrable from a hacking perspective because it's so much shorter ._.
* イデアの日, the title, was translated by the developers as "Day of the Idea", which honesetly I like, but it's supposedly not actually an "accurate" translation. "The Idea", is not a proper noun of anything in the game, but "イデア", which they translate to "Idea", can also be translated as "Edea" (look at Final Fantasy VIII, Edea's name is spelled the same there in Japanese!), who IS a major character. The furigana in the game's manual indicates that the reading of 日 is "ひ" and according to multiple dictionaries, that can also translate to "(unfortunate/bad) case/event", so a more literal translation could be "Event of Edea"
    * Much smarter people noticed this before me, I'm just confirming that I agree with this, based of what I know about the game and some very basic searching
    * A less clunky synonym for a "unfortunate case/event" is "an incident", so what I've seen others suggest is that "The Edea Incident" is a more "accurate" translation of what the original name is trying to say, AND it makes sense within the context of the game's story. And I like the way "The Edea Incident" sounds just as much as "Day of the Idea" tbh
    * That said, I'm somewhat leaning towards keeping the original title intact out of respect to the original devs.
* The author of the walkthrough translated the common healing items 赤チン, 青チン, and 黒チン as "Red Blood", "Blue Blood", and "Black Blood", respectively. Which in english sounds kinda odd
    * So, googling 赤チン brings up this stuff, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merbromin, some sort of topical antiseptic that i've never heard of because apparantly has mercury in it (wtf) and it's banned in the US
        * "blood" might have been some sort of nickname for the stuff in Japan?
    * But from what I can tell, liquid Iodine, is basically the safe equivalent of that stuff. So my thoughts are that "Iodine Red", "Idoine Blue", and "Iodine Black" could be suitable names for these that would be meaningful to english speakers, but still convey what the original script depicted
    * Presumably "Blue" and "Black" were meant to indicate that it's the same stuff but more potent, within the game's world
        * googling 黒チン leads to nsfw content, just as a heads up @_@
