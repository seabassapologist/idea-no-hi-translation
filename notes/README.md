# Notes

* [Technical Notes](/notes/technical_notes.md) - Notes regarding disassembly, code logic, and text encoding
* [Lookup Tables](/notes/lookup_tables.md) - Tables that map out the non-Kanji text encoding and pascal strings in ROM
* [Kanji Lookup Tables](/notes/kanji_lookup_tables.md) - Tables that map out the Kanji text encoding in ROM
* [Romhacking.net Forum Notes](/notes/romhacking_forum_notes.md) - Other peoples' notes I copied from an old thread on the romhacking.net forum, for quick access, and so they aren't lost. Vehek's notes were **invaluable** to getting a head start on this project, and they will be thanked/credited accordingly when it's finished!
* [Script Notes](/notes/script_notes.md) - Thoughts I've had regarding translations of certain aspects of the script
* [Miscellaneous Discoveries](/notes/misc_discoveries.md) - Interesting stuff I found when disassembling/debugging the ROM data, that turned out to not really be super important for translation hacking
